# Java-RMI-Query-CSV-File
Query CSV File using Java RMI Client/Server


This application working on Java RMI, to Query CSV file through the network.
the client will send the query to the server, the code will be executed on the server.
the server will use Apache Commons CSV  to read the CSV file.
the result of the query will be streamed to the client through the network.
the client will read the result and display it to the end user.


I will record youtube video, how to run the server and the client.
this example just to show you the concepts of Java RMI.
